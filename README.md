# Scientific Computing
This repository contains scientific computing projects completed as I studied Numerical Methods: An Inquiry Based Approach with Python by Eric Sullivan. The work is focused on solving mathematical and scientific problems using numerical methods in Python. The primary focus was implementing algorithms for algebra, calculus, differential equations, and signal processing, with an emphasis on both computation and visualization of results. The major topics that show up throughout these projects are as follows:
