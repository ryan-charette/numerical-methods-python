# What is a vector and how can it be represented in python?
u = np.array([1,2,3])

print("We are working on u: \n", u)
print("The shape of u is: ", u.shape)
print("The len of u is: ", len(u))

# What are the defining properties of a vector?
#1 
print("First property is: ____, which is computed in python to be ", " for u")
#2
print("Second property is: ____, which is computed in python to be ", " for u")
