He discovered the first of a small body of asteroids trapped in Jupiter’s orbit. No spacecraft has ever been to this population of small bodies, called the Trojan asteroids. The Lucy mission, launching this year, will be the first.}, journal={NASA}, author={Turner, David Dezell}, year={2021}, month={Feb}, language={und} }

@misc{Greenspan_2014, title={Stability of the Lagrange Points , L 4 and L 5 Thomas Greenspan January}, abstractNote={A proof of the stability of the non collinear Lagrange Points, L4 and L5. We will start by covering the basics of stability, stating a theorem (without proof) with a few corollaries, and then turn to the Lagrange points, proving first the stability of all Lagrange points in the z-direction and then restricting our attention to the the points, L4 and L5.}, author={Greenspan, Thomas}, year={2014}, language={en} }

In this paper, we present a review of the three-body problem in the context of both historical and modern developments. We describe the general and restricted (circular and elliptic) three-body problems, different analytical and numerical methods of finding solutions, methods for performing stability analysis, search for periodic orbits and resonances, and application of the results to some interesting astronomical and space dynamical settings. We also provide a brief presentation of the general and restricted relativistic three-body problems, and discuss their astronomical applications.}, author={Musielak, Z.
